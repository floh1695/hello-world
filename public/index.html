        The early stages of the internet was a place that, as far as I could tell, lacked standardization.
        A world where everyone came up with their own unique solutions to every problem! 
        Sounds like great fun, right?
        Well unfortunatly, this world had many problems. 
        For example, imagine moving to a new company and learning your way of doing things is now useless information!
        This would happen since, like you had to, the new company has already created an internal standard.
        Not fun dude; now you have to relearn everything.

        Luckily for us, these problems have been, mostly, solved in the modern internet world.
        The need for standardization has been answered with the rise of many tools that are commonly used.
        Now there is a good chance that any tools you learn at one workplace will likely be used at another workplace.
        Sounds good to me!
      </p>

        Now this all begs the question, where is the internet going?
        I hope that the trend of tool standardization continues as it has been.
        I have a feeling one of the next big problems we will have to deal with will be of an interplanetary internet!
